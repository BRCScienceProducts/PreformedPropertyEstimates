# PreformedPropertyEstimates
Gridded global estimates of preformed biogeochemical seawater properties.
3D longitude (360 degrees) by latitude (180 degrees) by 33 depth levels

Properties include:
Phosphate (pP)
Nitrate (pN)
Silicate (pSi)
Total titration seawater alkalinity (pTA)

Calculated using the approach detailed in Carter et al. (submitted)
Summary: A transport matrix (OCIM) is used to infer where interior ocean seawater last left surface mixed layers.  Then (Default) regressions (or interpolations) are used to infer the initial properties of these contributions.

"Default" estimates are obtained using the regression approach detailed in this manuscript.  "Interpolated" estimates are obtained using the interpolated properties at the base of the mixed layers.

Preformed properties are assumed to be at steady state and are inferred from the hydrographic record from ~1970 to ~2014.  These estimates are challenged by long term trends in N, P, O2, and TA.  The effects of these trends should be small, compared to the significant uncertainties in the estimates, for decades yet.
