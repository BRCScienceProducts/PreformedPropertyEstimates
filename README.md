# PreformedPropertyEstimates
Gridded global estimates of preformed biogeochemical seawater properties.
3D longitude (360 degrees) by latitude (180 degrees) by 33 depth levels

Properties include:
Phosphate (pP)
Nitrate (pN)
Silicate (pSi)
Total titration seawater alkalinity (pTA)

Calculated using the approach detailed in Carter et al. (submitted)
v0 is the version at submission
... will be updated to v1 upon initial online publication

Preformed properties are assumed to be at steady state and are inferred from the hydrographic record from ~1970 to ~2014.  These estimates are challenged by long term trends in N, P, O2, and TA, though the effects of these trends should be small, compared to the significant uncertainties in the estimates, for decades yet.
